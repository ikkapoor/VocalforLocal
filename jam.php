                The kind of carpets made in Kashmir resemble Central Asian styles like bokhara and Turkish makes. Often, a cotton warp is mixed with a woollen weft. Silk carpets are also made. Medallions, horse designs, and hunting and animal scenes are the motifs used. <br>Floral and plant designs in unusual sizes can also be found. Trellis designs, the hallmark of Mughal traditions, are combined with plant motifs. Medallions in many varieties and shapes are found along the borders. In these carpets, repetition does not give rise to monotony.<br> Since carpet-weaving originated in Persia and travelled to Kashmir, the designs are mostly local variations of Persian themes. In addition to the design, the knotting of the carpet is the most important aspect determining durability and value. <b>Kashmiri carpets are always hand-knotted.</b>
